Civitas means city and refers to the heavenly city of Jerusalem, the city of peace with a dazzling beauty, but also to the earthly Jerusalem and the many other pilgrimage cities in Europe. In this performance, the stories of a medieval and a modern woman, both on pilgrimage, are intertwined. The medieval woman travels incognito to important pilgrimage destinations throughout Europe and in this way comes to terms with the great loss of her husband and her son.</description></item><item><title>Vita Hildegardis Bingenis</title><link>/programmas/vita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/programmas/vita/</guid><description>Vita Hildegardis Bingensis Vita Hildegardis Bingensis is a concert series with the new ensemble Anime Beatitudinis Cantando with the singers Agnieszka Chabowska, Cora Schmeiser and Marsja Mudde. The program is about the life of Hildegard von Bingen with music by this famous abbess himself. In seven scenes, the singers immerse themselves in the world of the nuns led by Hildegard in the 12th century monastery on the Rupertsberg.
