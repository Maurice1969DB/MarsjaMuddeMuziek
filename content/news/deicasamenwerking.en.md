### Collaboration with the International Chant Academy

In May, Marsja successfully collaborated with the International Chant Academy in the USA, giving an online lecture and two practical sessions as part of their Hands on With Hildegard lecture series. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and the depth and interdisciplinary approach were particularly appreciated.

The collaboration continues with three new online sessions on the music of Hildegard von Bingen:

- **January 31, 2026** - 6:00 PM (Amsterdam time)
- **February 18, 2026** - 5:30 PM (Amsterdam time)
- **March 18, 2026** - 5:30 PM (Amsterdam time)

This is ideal for those who are unable to reach the monthly Hildegard Study Days near 's-Hertogenbosch due to distance or time constraints. Click [here](/en/workshops/hildegard-online/) for more information and registration.
