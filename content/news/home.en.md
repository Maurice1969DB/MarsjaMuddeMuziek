### Marsja Mudde Muziek: experienced in giving experience ###
Experienced in giving experience is the motto of Marsja Mudde Muziek and what Marsja stands for as a person and musician. According to her, making music is really an experience profession. As a musician you are trained based on what the teacher experiences while listening to you. And through a lot of repetition and practice with the teacher's feedback, or after a lot of experience, you master the subject.

Graduation is not the end of experience. Time and again, learning and experiencing remain paramount, for example when new repertoire has to be learned, or when a new insight arises about the repertoire. Experience also helps to become a better teacher. To become better at listening to the student, at hearing what is going well and what isn't going so well, and at guiding the student to learn through experience as well. Concerting can also be described as letting the audience experience what the repertoire does to them and showing what it does to the musician. And in contact with the audience and with the content and experience intended by the text author and the composer, it is in that contact that Marsja experiences the greatest professional joy!
