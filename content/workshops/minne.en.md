Two days

#### Description:
In this workshop we work for two days on the beautiful repertoire of the Minnesang, a music genre in medieval Germany and the Netherlands, derived from the music of the French Troubadours and Trouvères. The so-called Courtly Love reigns supreme in this period and inspires many to flowery poetry, which is still inextricably linked to music in this period. The participants work in pairs with two songs each. In addition, the group as a whole is also working on a few pieces. Players of medieval instruments (e.g. recorder, fiddle, portative) who can and want to accompany themselves or other participants are also very welcome, but the main focus is on expressing the text.

This workshop is available on request. Please contact [Marsja](mailto:info@marsjamudde.nl) for more information.
