### General information theme workshops for enthusiasts, advanced and (pre-) professionals
Below you will find the general information and conditions for the themed workshops. The conditions for workshops for schools and companies are incorporated in the offer.

#### By who?
The themed workshops are all given by soprano Marsja Mudde, a specialist in the music of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. A second teacher may be involved if necessary. You will find information about this in the description.
#### For whom?
The target group is stated in the description of the workshop. If you think you do not belong to the target group, but would still like to participate, do not hesitate to contact us. Perhaps there is an opportunity for you to learn about this subject at Marsja Mudde Muziek.
#### Number of participants?
The theme workshop can already take place from 3 participants. Maximum number of participants for the theme workshops is always 16. In case of over-registration, a second workshop with the same theme can be planned.
#### Where?
Most theme workshops take place in 's-Hertogenbosch or the immediate vicinity, at a location that suits the music and the number of participants. Some workshops are at a different location, which is then stated in the information. The exact location will be announced in time.
#### What time?
Coffee and tea are ready at a quarter to 10. Work is always from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., ending (on the last day) with a short informal 'show moment', where interested parties may come and listen.
#### What does it cost?
The costs are stated in the information about the individual themed workshops. This amount always includes VAT, coffee and tea, a soup or salad for lunch (you should also bring your own lunch), one-off telephone preparation coaching and study material.
#### Stack discount
If you want to participate in several workshops, you receive a "stack discount": with two workshops you receive a 5% discount on the total bill, with three workshops 7.5%, with four or more workshops 10%.
