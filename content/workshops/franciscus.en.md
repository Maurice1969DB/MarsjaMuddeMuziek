#### Description:
On the occasion of Animal Day, also the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi, the namesake of our current pope, we work in this workshop on music from the Italian Middle Ages and early Renaissance. The selected songs are about Francis and/or about his beloved animals and creation and come from the repertoire of de Lauda and Trecento, among others. Players of medieval and renaissance instruments are also very welcome, but the emphasis is on singing.
