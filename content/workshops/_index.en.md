### Workshops

Marsja Mudde Muziek offers special workshops on medieval and renaissance music. There are usually several workshops in the agenda for singers who are interested in this repertoire. If there is sufficient interest, these workshops can be given on other days in consultation, or, for example, especially for your ensemble or choir.
Marsja not only gives workshops for people who already sing, but also for schools, museums and companies. Sometimes singing or music history comes first, sometimes other themes. On request, Marsja also develops tailor-made workshops for all kinds of target groups.
