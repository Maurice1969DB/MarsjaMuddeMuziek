Vita Hildegardis Bingensis is a concert series with the new ensemble Anime Beatitudinis Cantando with the singers Agnieszka Chabowska, Cora Schmeiser and Marsja Mudde. The program is about the life of Hildegard von Bingen with music by this famous abbess himself. In seven scenes, the singers immerse themselves in the world of the nuns led by Hildegard in the 12th century monastery on the Rupertsberg. The audience is treated to titillating vocals and lacks senses to take it all in. While enjoying, one learns something about the life history of this Sybille of the Rhine and her time. Can be booked for the whole of 2023 and 2024.
