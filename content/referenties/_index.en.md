### What participants say

#### Hildegard von Bingen workshops & lessons

> "I can't begin to describe what a joy it is to study with Marsja Mudde in private lessons and in her Hildegard Study Days! She doesn't just bring technical expertise to the classroom; her whole being exudes this music! I feel not only like I am becoming a better musician, but also a better person when studying with her. Highly recommend."

> "Marsja was able to demonstrate how to integrate von Bingen's music in a full bodied way, using the text, the human heartbeat, and shapes to give beautiful lines to the music. I've never been to a talk that was equal parts mystical and practical, which was a lovely surprise. I'd love to hear more from Marsja."

---

> "The class was not just about reading music, it was about bringing Hildegard's process of composing to life. Her knowledge of Hildegard's music was much deeper than anything I had experienced before, going beyond notation and into the realm of emotion and inspiration."

> "Instead of just laying down a 'this is how it is,' Marsja made me feel empowered to THINK, and that makes me much more excited about learning more. I liked the way we got a taste of the depth of her expertise, with the way she could come up with additional examples to illustrate any point, while at the same time she was sincerely willing to teach the basics. She gave a genuinely 'academic' (knowledge-seeking, collegial) feeling to the course, instead of a didactic or performance-oriented one."

> "I'm doing a Hildegard sing this fall, by popular demand, and I would not have attempted it without the information in this course. Marsja is skilled at connecting vocal technique to the performance and meaning of Hildegard's music. I have more freedom as a soloist and a better connection to our ensemble because of her teaching."

#### Singing lessons

> "After becoming enthusiastic following a course on Hildegard von Bingen given by Marsja, I decided to take lessons with her. Meanwhile I have had the pleasure to follow a number of lessons. After years of lessons given by a man, I am now very happy with the input of a woman. Marsja carefully builds her lessons, in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Mainly in respect to forming vowels and resonance I learn a lot from her."

> "I have had lessons from Marsja for about 2 years now. After a cup of tea we begin with stretch and balance exercises. This is very good for getting to yourself, bringing your breath at the right position, grounding, relaxing and for correcting your posture. Marsja takes plenty of time and is very good at explaining what is happening with your voice. Even more important I find that Marsja makes me experience that I can do much more with my voice than I think."
