### Hildegard StudyDay Online via International Chant Academy
In May, Marsja successfully collaborated with the International Chant Academy in the USA, giving an online lecture and two practical sessions as part of their Hands on With Hildegard lecture series. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with the depth and interdisciplinary approach particularly appreciated.
By popular demand, the collaboration will continue with three more practical online sessions (via Zoom), the second of which is scheduled for November 1st. This is ideal for those who are unable to attend the monthly Hildegard Study Days in the Den Bosch area due to distance or time constraints.
