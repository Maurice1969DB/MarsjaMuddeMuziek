### Singinglessons for individuals and groups
Since quite some years I enjoy giving technical and interpretational singinglessons to individual students as well as groups. The content of my classes is individually suited, dependent on the questions being asked. One mainly asks about technical things, the other has questions about pronunciation or tempi. A third might wonder how to approach ensemblesinging. Sometimes even there is no question at all, just a longing for having fun singing together. There are many possibilities, and every question is worth asking. So make an appointment for an introduction lesson and we will explore how to work towards answers and new experience!
 
#### The text dictates what voice and body should do
Starting point in my classes is always the fact that the text dictates what your voice and the rest of your body should do while singing it. In addition to this basic technical approach, stylespecific techniques are being taught. Singing 12th century chant from the low countries for instance has major differences compared to singing a 16th century madrigal by the Italian prince Carlo Gesualdo. Apart from the distance in time and geografically, the social background and function of the piece play an important role. Moreover, the musical form (monophonic versus polyphonic, free prose versus strophic poetry) and the textual and symbolical contents differ a lot. Finally, language, tongue and language area - even when both pieces would be in Latin - influences the techniques needed for singing the piece. These things seem to be very obvious, but not everybody realises them, once they have begun singing.
 
#### Some students about their experiences:
##### Mirjam:
"I became enthousiastic following a course on Hildegard von Bingen given by Marsja and decided to follow lessons with her. Meanwhile I have had the pleasure to follow a number of lessons. After years of lessons given by a man, I am now very happy with the input of a woman. Marsja carefully builds her lessons, in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Mainly in respect to forming vowels and resonance I learn a lot from her."

##### Henk:
"I have had lessons from Marsja for about 2 years now. How is such a lesson built?
After a cup of tea we begin with stretch and balance exercises. This is very good for getting to yourself, bringing your breath at the right position, grounding, relaxing and for correcting your posture.
Then singing techniques are being taught. My focus right now is on how to relax while singing in the higher registers. Marsja takes plenty of time for that and is very good at explaining what is happening with your voice. Even more important I find that Marsja makes me experience that I can do much more with my voice than I think.
Towards the end of the lesson, the techniques that were taught before are applied in a piece of repertoire."
