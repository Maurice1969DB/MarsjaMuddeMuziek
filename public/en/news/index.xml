      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;collaboration-with-the-international-chant-academy&#34;&gt;Collaboration with the International Chant Academy&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In May, Marsja successfully collaborated with the International Chant Academy in the USA, giving an online lecture and two practical sessions as part of their Hands on With Hildegard lecture series. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and the depth and interdisciplinary approach were particularly appreciated.&#xA;By popular demand, the collaboration will continue with three more practical online sessions (via Zoom), the first of which is scheduled for September 5th. This is ideal for those who are unable to reach the monthly Hildegard Study Days near &amp;rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch due to distance or time constraints.

According to her, making music is really an experience profession. As a musician you are trained based on what the teacher experiences while listening to you. And through a lot of repetition and practice with the teacher&amp;rsquo;s feedback, or after a lot of experience, you master the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
