      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anime Beatitudinis Cantando is a professional vocal women&amp;rsquo;s ensemble that breathes new life into the music of the Middle Ages and early Renaissance in a titillating way. The programs are distinguished by idiosyncratic, creative and interdisciplinary total concepts, in which the visible and audible love for this music is combined with texts and images, sometimes also other sensory resources, that together tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cantus Modalis</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;cantus-modalis&#34;&gt;Cantus Modalis&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After her pension in 2007, Rebecca Stewart founded Cantus Modalis, which has both an educational and a performing branch. The main purpose of the educational Center Cantus Modalis is to study and teach the underlying principles of the living modal traditions of the non-Western world in conjunction with the long-dead modal traditions of the Western world, this with the intention of reanimating the Western sense of identification with its modal roots. From this perspective Cantus Modalis investigates the oral/modal roots of medieval and early Renaissance music which are ‘hidden’ within the written traditions. These ‘secrets’ often mirror important aspects of the musical esthetics of these periods which reflect, for lack of a better term ‘the cosmic layering of the divine. Cantus Modalis is convinced that the message of this very strong but often misunderstood music is as relevant today as it was 500 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
