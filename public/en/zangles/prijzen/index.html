      <h3 id="prices-and-conditions-singing-lessons-at-marsja-mudde-music-from-january-2023">Prices and conditions Singing lessons at Marsja Mudde Music from January 2023</h3>
<p>An ** introductory lesson ** of 5 minutes costs 75 Euro. When a lesson package is subsequently taken out, it will be refunded in part (50% in case of a 5 lesson package) or in full (in case of a 10 or 20 lesson package). When you take out a package of 20 lessons, you will also receive a nice gift.</p>
<p>For each lesson package that is closed, the <strong>learning objectives</strong> are reviewed together. Learning objectives can be in the field of style-specific and/or general singing technique, interpretation, pronunciation, singing in harmony, early notation reading, repertoire knowledge, analysis, stage presence, and so on.</p>
<p>All lessons are <strong>including</strong> coffee or tea, digital teaching materials and answers to short questions between lessons. In principle, teaching materials are delivered by e-mail. Questions – provided they are short and about the subject matter – can be asked by telephone, WhatsApp or e-mail.</p>
<p>The <strong>class duration</strong> is in principle 60 minutes. It is also possible to take shorter or longer lessons, adapted to individual needs and attention span. Prices for this and for duo or group lessons are derived from the basic rate.</p>
<p>The <strong>basic price</strong> for separate individual lessons will go to EUR 62.50 per hour from 1 January 2023. Derived from this basic price, there are also affordable lesson packages available of 5 pieces (4% discount), 10 pieces (8% discount) or 20 pieces (12% discount). When a lesson package is concluded, the intended lesson frequency and lesson day are also recorded. The advantage for you, apart from the discount, is that there is definitely room for you in the agenda. The advantage for Marsja Mudde Muziek is simpler planning and more continuity.</p>
<p>A recommendation for choral or ensemble singers is the <strong>duo lesson</strong>, where you have 90 minutes of lessons together. You will then attend each other&rsquo;s 30 minutes of individual technical instruction and work together on polyphonic repertoire for 30 minutes. A separate duo lesson costs 110 Euro for together. Duo lessons can also be taken out as a package, with individual learning objectives, but please note: if one of them is unable to attend, a separate individual lesson will be charged.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson packs are valid for a limited time</strong>. The basic principle here is that 1 in 5 lessons can be moved up without any problems. A few examples: with biweekly lessons and a 5 lesson package, the validity is 12 weeks. With weekly lessons and a 5 lesson package, the validity is 6 weeks. Weekly 10 lesson packs can be spread over 12 weeks. Lessons can always be made up again within the period of validity. If the validity has expired, then unfortunately the outstanding lessons will expire, unless expressly agreed otherwise.</p>
<p>Marsja Mudde Muziek works with a <strong>flexible schedule</strong>, so lessons can also be taken during school holidays and, if desired, it is possible to deviate from the fixed lesson day. In the absence of the teacher on the fixed lesson day (for example at a concert or holiday), a replacement lesson date is jointly sought and the validity of the lesson package can, if necessary, be extended by the number of weeks that the lesson could not take place.</p>
<p>In the event of <strong>absence</strong> of the student, up to 24 hours in advance - if within the validity of the lesson package - the lesson can be moved to another day or time free of charge. If it is less than 24 hours in advance or if there is a no-show, the lesson will unfortunately be charged or removed from the lesson package, regardless of the reason.</p>
<p>If you threaten to arrive <strong>too late</strong> for the lesson, for example due to a train delay, please let us know as soon as possible, because after 15 minutes of waiting in vain without notice, the teacher will decide to spend her time differently and the lesson will be cancelled and considered a no-show.</p>
<p><strong>Invoices</strong> for lesson packages and individual lessons must be paid within 14 days of the invoice date. If the payment term has expired, you will receive a friendly reminder and then possibly an unfriendly reminder and Marsja Mudde Muziek has the legal right to cancel discounts and/or charge administration costs (15%). If payment is still not made after an unfriendly reminder, a collection agency will be called in. However, let&rsquo;s hope it doesn&rsquo;t have to come to that.</p>
<p>It is possible to deviate from these terms and conditions upon request. In the case of <strong>customization</strong>, an individual contract is concluded.</p>
