According to her, making music is really an experience profession. As a musician you are trained based on what the teacher experiences while listening to you. And through a lot of repetition and practice with the teacher&amp;rsquo;s feedback, or after a lot of experience, you master the subject.</description></item><item><title/><link>/news/website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/news/website/</guid><description>Marsja Mudde Muziek has a completely renewed website.

Rebecca Stewart and Margot Kalse. I was given directions for interpretation and technical directions to support that interpretation. Gradually it became more and more clear to me how closely interpretation and technique are connected. In fact, in my view, they can no longer be approached separately.</description></item><item><title/><link>/zangles/prijzen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/zangles/prijzen/</guid><description>Prices and conditions Singing lessons at Marsja Mudde Music from January 2023 An ** introductory lesson ** of 5 minutes costs 75 Euro.

The programs are distinguished by idiosyncratic, creative and interdisciplinary total concepts, in which the visible and audible love for this music is combined with texts and images, sometimes also other sensory resources, that together tell a story.
The sound and interpretation of the music by Anime Beatitudinis Cantando is characterized by the fluent following of the original notation, attention to the dialect and accent, attention to the modal harmony and acoustic effects and therefore responding to what the music wants from the singers (and not the other way around).</description></item><item><title>Book "Zicht op Hildegard"</title><link>/products/zichtop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/products/zichtop/</guid><description>Book &amp;ldquo;Zicht op Hildegard; leven, visioenen, geneeskunst, muziek&amp;rdquo; (in Dutch) Hildegard van Bingen was a strong woman with versatile talents, according to the book &amp;ldquo;Zicht op Hildegard&amp;rdquo;, which appeared at the end of 2020. This book is an accessible introduction to the life and work of these twelfth-century Benedictines, after which you will definitely want to go on a pilgrimage to her monastery in Eibingen, Germany.

The main purpose of the educational Center Cantus Modalis is to study and teach the underlying principles of the living modal traditions of the non-Western world in conjunction with the long-dead modal traditions of the Western world, this with the intention of reanimating the Western sense of identification with its modal roots.</description></item><item><title>Civitas</title><link>/programmas/civitas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/programmas/civitas/</guid><description>Civitas Civitas is a project of Marsja Mudde Muziek. Civitas means city and refers to the heavenly city of Jerusalem, the city of peace with a dazzling beauty, but also to the earthly Jerusalem and the many other pilgrimage cities in Europe. In this performance, the stories of a medieval and a modern woman, both on pilgrimage, are intertwined. The medieval woman travels incognito to important pilgrimage destinations throughout Europe and in this way comes to terms with the great loss of her husband and her son.</description></item><item><title>Curriculum Vitae</title><link>/about/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/cv/</guid><description>Medieval and Renaissance specialist and soprano Marsja Mudde (Ridderkerk, 1976) was fascinated from an early age by increasingly older classical vocal music. From the start of her singing studies at the Fontys Conservatory in Tilburg, she specialized in the Middle Ages and Renaissance with Dr. Rebecca Stewart, head of the Early Vocal Ensemble Music department. After her extraordinarily successful graduation concert on Saint Michael and All Angels, she followed many more specialization courses at master level.</description></item><item><title>Die Minne mint ende singt</title><link>/workshops/minne/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/workshops/minne/</guid><description>Die Minne mint ende singt: Medieval Sung Love Poetry from the Netherlands and Germany

Description: In this workshop we work for two days on the beautiful repertoire of the Minnesang, a music genre in medieval Germany and the Netherlands, derived from the music of the French Troubadours and Trouv√®res.
