The so-called Courtly Love reigns supreme in this period and inspires many to flowery poetry, which is still inextricably linked to music in this period. The participants work in pairs with two songs each. In addition, the group as a whole is also working on a few pieces. Players of medieval instruments (e.g. recorder, fiddle, portative) who can and want to accompany themselves or other participants are also very welcome, but the main focus is on expressing the text.</p></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=/workshops/kerst/>Een middeleeuwse kerst</a></h1><div><h3 id=a-medieval-christmas>A Medieval Christmas:</h3><p>Medieval Christmas carols from the Netherlands</p><h4 id=target-audience>Target audience:</h4><p>Enthusiasts of all levels</p><h4 id=date>Date:</h4><p>December 9, 2023</p><h4 id=cost>Cost:</h4><p>87 euros per person</p><h4 id=definition>Definition:</h4><p>The feast of the birth of Christ is one of the most important feasts in the Christian tradition, even the most important in the Middle Ages. The music written for Christmas was therefore more often polyphonic in comparison with other repertoire, often had beautiful decorations (melisms, &rsquo;trills&rsquo;, etc.) and, according to tradition, was more often accompanied by instruments. The repertoire for this workshop has been chosen from medieval manuscripts from the Netherlands, and richly illustrates the Christmas story.</p><p>An important part of the chosen repertoire can be found in the book &lsquo;Liederen van Licht en Troost&rsquo; (M. Kalse and M. Mudde, 2013) in which an anthology of songs from the so-called Modern Devotion is reproduced in facsimile, with transcription of the texts and with translations in modern Dutch. This book will be used during the workshop.</p><p>Players of medieval and renaissance instruments are also welcome to add to the festive mood, but the emphasis is on the singing.</p></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=/workshops/algemeen/>General information</a></h1><div><h3 id=general-information-theme-workshops-for-enthusiasts-advanced-and-pre--professionals>General information theme workshops for enthusiasts, advanced and (pre-) professionals</h3><p>Below you will find the general information and conditions for the themed workshops.

In the Middle Ages, too, people traveled a lot and in order to keep pace and sense, they often sang. The journeys made by the Middle Ages often served to visit distant relatives, as a messenger for high-ranking people, as a war path (crusades!) or as penance: the pilgrimages. Santiago da Compostella is still an important place of pilgrimage. In this three-day workshop we explore some surviving polyphonic pilgrim songs from the Codex Calixtinus, supplemented with songs from the Codex Las Huelgas, the Llibre Vermeil and the Cantigas de Santa Maria. Intonation, balance and expression are the learning objectives.</p></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=/workshops/opmaat/>Tailor made workshops</a></h1><div><h3 id=customized-workshops>Customized workshops</h3><p>Marsja Mudde Muziek provides tailor-made workshops for all kinds of occasions and target groups.</p><h4 id=possibilities>Possibilities</h4><p>On request, changes can be made to an existing workshop, such as the location, schedule or duration of the workshop, the number of participants, the precise content or learning objectives, or the target group.
